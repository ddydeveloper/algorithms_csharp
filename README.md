There is a number of data structures and algorithms implemented with C# to get basics:
- **Graph**: BFS, DFS, LCA, topologic sort and Dejkstra
- **Sequence**: quick sort, merge sort, binary search
- **Multi threading**: read write lock API and queue implementation, lock free stack implementation

There is also a number of benchmarks to compare performance of custom implemented algorithms and .net platform API:
